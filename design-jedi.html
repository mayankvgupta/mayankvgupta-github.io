                    <p>Being entry level designers ourselves we felt a lack of resources for design students to prepare for their interviews and design challenges. Also, it difficult to find the right jobs within the swarm of thousands of different job boards out there. We asked ourselves the following question.  </p>
                    <p>Where do UX designers go to find out about jobs, presentation skills, design challenges, and the other miscellaneous things they need in order to prepare for an interview?</p>

                    <p>After the preliminary research we brainstormed some initial wireframes, followed by a style guide. Finally, we designed the high-fidelity prototype and further conducted 5 more user tests. </p>

                    <h4 class="sp-title">Innovative Methodology</h4>
                    <p>Our participants have implemented a variety of ways to tackle their job hunt. They are very meticulous and pore through job listings, set alerts, and follow their favorite companies on LinkedIn. They talk to people in the industry, making new connections. And they are thriving in this remote environment which has removed some of the anxiety they face when interviewing and presenting their work.</p>
                    <h4 class="sp-title">Needs to be Addressed</h4>
                    <p>There were several things about the job hunt that our participants wished to address:</p>
                    <ul class="sub-order-list">
                        <li>Staying engaged during the interview and coming across as interested and upbeat</li>
                        <li>Making portfolio better geared toward what they want to pursue in UX design</li>
                        <li>Practicing verbal and written communication skills</li>
                        <li>Improving UI design skills</li>
                        <li>Enhancing storytelling skills during presentations and in case studies</li>

                            <p>The landing page is text heavy and doesn't entice the user. 2 of the 3 observation study participants reported that they wouldn’t want to attend the conference based on the first impression of the website.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 800;">Although the card sort partially failed, as we got 61 different categories at the end of it. This revealed a general confusion amongst the users with our labelling.</span></p> -->

                    <p>Design Jedi gives the user a platform to practice and improve their storytelling skills using automated recordings and gives them tips on how to improve their case studies and portfolios. It is the only platform that lets user prepare for interviews, by using video indexers and a set of previously asked questions from a particular company.</p>
                    <h4 class="sp-title">Networking</h4>
                    <p>Design Jedi serves as a one-stop solution for users to connect and build relationships with professionals. It also helps users understand how to maintain those relationships, find mentors and provides links to more specific Slack channels and design communities.</p>
                    <h4 class="sp-title">Job Hunting</h4>
                    <p>Job search can be overwhelming and difficult. There are thousands of different job boards out there with thousands of postings for different fields. Design Jedi is not a conventional job board like LinkedIn, it is dedicated to the design community. It aggregates specific design jobs from all the different job boards into one single product.</p>

Although the design wasn't completely ready we got some valuable feedback.</p>
